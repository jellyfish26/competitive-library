# Competitive Library
This Competitive Library is lazy made by jellyfish.  
[Reference](https://jellyfish26.github.io/competitive-library/ja)

## Library
I implemented the following.

### Algorithm
- Cumulative Sum

### Data Structure
- Binary Indexed Tree
- Segment Tree
- UnionFind

### Geometry
- Affine Transformation
- Calculation about circle
- Matrix
- Vertex (Calculation between vertices, etc..)

### Graph
- Base (Graph composition)
- Euler Tour
- Count up Euler Tour
- Dijkstra
- Kruskal
- Lowest Common Ancestor (by doubling)
- ReRooting (Omnidirectional? tree DP)

### Math
- ModInt (Int that can calculate modulo)
- Combination
- Factorial
- Prime Factor

### Persistent Data Structure
- Fast reference array (Support only reference of backward generation)
- Array
- Binary Indexded Tree
- Segment Tree
- Union Find
